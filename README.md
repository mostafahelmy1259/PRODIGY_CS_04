Simple Keylogger

Create a basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. Focus on logging the keys pressed and saving them to a file.
Note: Ethical considerations and permissions are crucial for projects involving keyloggers.

This is a simple keylogger program. Once it runs, it records every single key pressed with its date & time. And save it 
in keylog.txt file in the same directory or you can change saving file place as you want.
